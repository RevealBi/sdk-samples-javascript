Proof of concept that demonstrates how to use the **Reveal SDK DOM** to generate the underlying data that makes up a specific visualization or a data item (Bar, Column, etc.) in a visualization.

In the `wwwroot` folder, run the `dashboard.html` file and note the tooltip menu items added.  
The code is heavily commented so you can see what is actually happening.
