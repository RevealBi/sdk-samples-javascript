# Show Underlying Data in Reveal

Proof of concept that demonstrates how to use the **Reveal SDK DOM** to generate the underlying data that makes up a specific visualization or a data item (Bar, Column, etc.) in a visualization.

In the `wwwroot` folder, run the `dashboard.html` file and note the tooltip menu items added.  The `readme.md` in the `server` folder has details on the server-side code. The APIs on the server in Program.cs are generic, they will work with any visualization in any dashboard.

The code is commented so you can learn about the implementation..
